        <p>Hi there!</p>
        <p>Usually this is where one might introduce themself, but I think the banner above has already fulfilled that job – you know my name, and that 
          I like to code, design, and create music. . .</p>

        <p>. . .</p>

        <p>Alright, alright, I suppose I should tell you a little bit more than that. My experience as a coder began at the age of 14 when I began 
          developing my first game using a development platform called Roblox. Roblox is not only a platform for developing, but is also the platform 
          which you publish your game to. Roblox lets you build an environment in 3D and code using a language called Lua. After just 3 weeks of 
          developing one of my first major projects on Roblox, I released the first preliminary version of my game, "Freeze Tag", to the public. I took 
          the concept of the child's playground game, and created it in a virtual world with a few of my own twists. The same day I released the game, 
          it managed to rise to the top of the charts on Roblox with over 1000 concurrent players, stealing the number one spot. Throughout the game's 
          life span, it racked up over 1 million plays.</p>
        <p>Today, I still enjoy game development, but I've largely expanded my skillset since my early years of coding. I followed up my success in 
          game development by taking two years of computer science in high school, and then moving on to go to Conestoga College and graduate from the 
          IT Innovation and Design program. I now have programming experience that I can use to create websites, develop applications, work with 
          databases, and develop more extensive games. I also have experience with design through image creation and editing in PhotoShop, 
          3D modelling and animation in Blender, and video editing in Blender.</p>
        <p>Not related to my schooling, I also have enjoyed creating music as a hobby for the last 8 years. I began with an online music creation 
          platform called Noteflight, and eventually moved on to Ableton Live.</p>
        <p id="my-motto">I'm always looking for opportunities to express my creativity. Be it programming, designing, making music, or anything else, I love to 
          come up with innovative ideas to solve problems, and to create beautiful and inspiring works of art to share with the world.</p>
